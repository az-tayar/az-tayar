# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi there! 👋 I'm **Abdulaziz Al-Tayar**, an engineer with a strong passion for **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**. This repo will showcase my work and contributions in the previously mentioned fields.

## About Me

I graduated from **KFUPM** with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, achieving a cumulative GPA of 3.77 out of 4 and earning first honor class. My senior project design was awarded first rank in the 8th KFUPM Senior Project Design Expo.

Following my graduation, I made a deliberate transition into the field of Artificial Intelligence by completing various online courses, bootcamps, and AI-focused courses as part of my university education. Additionally, my senior design project, which was centered on AI, played a pivotal role in facilitating this career shift. I have since gained two years of professional experience as an AI engineer with several companies in Saudi Arabia. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Ottawa**.
